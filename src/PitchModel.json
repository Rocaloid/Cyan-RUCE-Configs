/*
    An example of RUCE Pitch-HSS adjustment configuration.
    
    PitchModel.json specifies the Harmonic Spectral Shape adjustment in relation
with fundamental frequency for each or each group of vocal unit.
    
    For each entry, "Wildcard" specifies the group of units that the entry
applies to. To minimize duplicate information, "Inherit" can be set to the
"Wildcard" of an entry defined previously.

    Parameters start with LDecay depict an asymmetric triangular spectral cavity
centered in "LDecay_Center" and extended from 0 hertz to "LDecay_Bound" hertz.
This setting is enabled when the instantaneous fundamental frequency exceeds the
lower limit, as described in "LDecay_F0". The cavity is deepened by logarithmic
amplitude of "LDecay_Sensitivity" every hertz the fundamental frequency is
larger than "LDecay_F0". The same function applies to parameters start with
HDecay except those are only enabled when fundamental frequency is larger than
"HDecay_F0".

    "HmncCurve", "NoizCurve", and "PhseCurve" are three independent control
point parameter sets. When aligned in the following format, the first row is
fundamental frequency; the second is the value on that particular control point.

    Values of "HmncCurve" indicate the amplification of sinusoidal component at
different fundamental frequencies, also in logarithmic amplitude.

    Values of "NoizCurve" are similar to "HmncCurve", except they describe the
noise(or breath) component.

    Values of "PhseCurve" indicate the synchronicity of instantaneous phase of
harmonics, or the "flatness" of phase spectrum at voice pulses. Usually lower at
high pitches, and vice versa.
